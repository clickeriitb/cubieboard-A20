cubieboard-A20
==============

There are three main reasons behind developing such a project and they are:

a) to develop this project on a hardware which is readily available at very affordable rates in the market,

b) to boot ubuntu operating system within an application running on android platform and at the same time switching on 
    to some other application. Thus by doing so, we get the benefit of doing multiple tasks simultaneously and

c) to release every bit of information we tried and tested in order to make it fully functional, in open source.
